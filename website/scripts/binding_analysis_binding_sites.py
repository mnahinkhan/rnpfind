class BindingSites:
    # Note that, in order to store binding sites in an ordered and non-redundant fashion from
    # multiple sources, a BindingSites class was implemented here.
    # The underlying implementation uses an ordered set to keep track of the ranges,
    # while adding a range to the set will check for overlaps and deal with them.

    # This may have been unnecessary, as there are O(nlogn) algorithms that produce merged
    # intervals given a list of ranges that can be found online.
    # For example: https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/69242/merging-overlapping-intervals

    # However I have implemented this now so I will keep it. However, this may allow
    # for simple dynamic additions and deletions with O(logn) each time.

    # Major modifications note July 21st 2019:
    # Most of the functions defined here have an implicit prerequisite that the binding site intervals
    # are non overlapping. As a result, the BindingSites.add() function makes sure that the overlapping
    # intervals are joined together to form a (possibly) larger interval that includes both of the
    # intervals.
    # However, now we see that some of the input data might be from experimental sources where overlaps
    # are very important (i.e. they represent confidence of binding regions because more sequences were
    # identified from that particular region). As a result, I am adding a second class variable that
    # keeps track of the raw binding sites, so that more functionality can be supported, such as
    # finding out the "depth of support" for RBPs binding to a specific nucleotide, as well as filters
    # for collapsing the overlapping region based on a criteria (e.g. only those with support depth 5
    # or above, etc.)
    #
    # Therefore, as of now, there are two main supported ways of using BindingSites:
    # 1. You add intervals and let BindingSites dynamically take care of overlapping intervals for
    # you. Note that as of now, this is a default behaviour that always occurs.
    # 2. You initialize BindingSites with a overlap_mode = True.
    # You then add intervals that are highly overlapping and, once complete, call the overlap_collapse()
    # function to collapse all the intervals as per your specifications. This sets the overlap_mode
    # to off. Following this, the representation of the BindingSites to the client magically
    # changes to the non-overlapping counterparts and enables the functions previously disabled
    # as overlap_mode was switched on.

        each nucleotide position has and chooses a cutoff point - e.g. all nucleotides
        above depth level of 5 is kept as binding sites and the rest are discarded.
        The cutoff point can  be chosen through multiple means.
        The modes supported right now are 'baseCoverNumber', 'TopDepthRatio',
        'TopDepthNumber', 'MinimumDepthNumber', 'TopSitesNumber','TopSitesRatio'

            'baseCoverNumber': Choose cut off based on number of bases that should be
                covered by the selected sites. The most stringent cutoff that achieves this
                criteria is selected, unless not possible*.

            'TopDepthRatio': Choose cutoff based on the fraction of highest depth
                coverage that should be supported as binding sites. For example,
                if the deepest coverage provided is 10 and number=0.4, then depth
                coverage of 10,9,8,7,and 6 is counted as binding sites and the
                rest are disregarded.

            'TopDepthNumber': The number of layers of depth from the highest depth support
                that should be selected is input, and the cutoff is accordingly selected.

            'MinimumDepthNumber': The cut-off is selected based on the minimum depth
                support each binding site should have.

            'TopSitesNumber': The cut-off is selected such that the top selected number
                of binding sites remains supported. For example, the top 100 sites may
                be preserved (from a set of, say, 1000 overlapping sites)

            'TopSitesRatio': The cut-off is selected much like above, but the ratio of
                top sites that should be selected is specified instead. For example,
                in the above example, 0.1 could be specified instead.

        As of now, calling overlap_collapse() loses all annotation data associated with
        the original range interval data.

        If inPlace is set to True, the BindingSites variable changes and collpases,
