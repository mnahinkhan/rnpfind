"""
Defines the class BindingSites, which represents one RNA molecule and regions
(intervals) where proteins bind on its structure.

BindingSites allows adding binding sites, removing binding sites, querying
binding sites given interval ranges of interest, measuring "correlations"
between pairs of sets of binding sites, printing BED files, and other related
functions.

Note that this project concerns itself with RNAs and proteins, but this class
could very well be used in other similar scenarios (like proteins interacting
with DNA).

    BindingSites allows adding binding sites, removing binding sites, querying
    binding sites given interval ranges of interest, measuring "correlations"
    between pairs of sets of binding sites, printing BED files, and other
    related functions.

    BindingSites can be used in two modes:
        1. when overlap_mode is on, sites are allowed to overlap. This allows
            for queries into "depths" of binding (i.e. how many proteins are
            binding together in a given interval on the RNA).
        2. when overlap_mode is off, sites that overlap are always merged
            together, with no "depth" information maintained. The identity and
            description of binding sites to be merged are also merged and
            associated with the merged binding site

    Note that this project concerns itself with RNAs and proteins, but this
    class could very well be used in other similar scenarios (like proteins
    interacting with DNA).

    The underlying implementation uses an ordered set to keep track of the
    ranges, while adding a range to the set will check for overlaps and deal
    with them.

    This may have been unnecessary, as there are O(nlogn) algorithms that
    produce merged intervals given a list of ranges that can be found online.
    For example:
    https://codereview.stackexchange.com/
                                questions/69242/merging-overlapping-intervals

    However I have implemented this now so I will keep it. However, this may
    allow for simple dynamic additions and deletions with O(logn) each time.

    Major modifications note July 21st 2019:
    Most of the functions defined here have an implicit prerequisite that the
    binding site intervals are non overlapping. As a result,
    the BindingSites.add() function makes sure that the overlapping intervals
    are joined together to form a (possibly) larger interval that includes both
    of the intervals.

    However, now we see that some of the input data might be from experimental
    sources where overlaps are very important (i.e. they represent confidence of
    binding regions because more sequences were identified from that particular
    region). As a result, I am adding a second class variable that keeps track
    of the raw binding sites, so that more functionality can be supported, such
    as finding out the "depth of support" for RBPs binding to a specific
    nucleotide, as well as filters for collapsing the overlapping region based
    on a criteria (e.g. only those with support depth 5 or above, etc.)

    Therefore, as of now, there are two main supported ways of using
    BindingSites:
        1. You add intervals and let BindingSites dynamically take care of
            overlapping intervals for you. Note that as of now, this is a
            default behaviour that always occurs.
        2. You initialize BindingSites with a overlap_mode = True.
            You then add intervals that are highly overlapping and, once
            complete, call the overlap_collapse() function to collapse all the
            intervals as per your specifications. This sets the overlap_mode to
            off. Following this, the representation of the BindingSites to the
            client magically changes to the non-overlapping counterparts and
            enables the functions previously disabled as overlap_mode was
            switched on.

    If overlap_collapse() is called too soon, everything has to be loaded again
    fresh.

        preset conditions.

        This function will always look at the 'depths' of how much coverage
        support each nucleotide position has and chooses a cutoff point - e.g.
        all nucleotides above depth level of 5 is kept as binding sites and the
        rest are discarded. The cutoff point can  be chosen through multiple
        means.

        The modes supported right now are 'baseCoverNumber', 'TopDepthRatio',
        'TopDepthNumber', 'MinimumDepthNumber', 'TopSitesNumber','TopSitesRatio'

            'baseCoverNumber': Choose cut off based on maximum number of bases
                that the selected sites are allowed to cover (laterally). The
                most stringent depth cutoff that achieves this criteria is
                selected, unless not possible*.

            'TopDepthRatio': Choose cutoff based on the fraction of highest
                depth coverage that should be supported as binding sites. For
                example, if the deepest coverage provided is 10 and number=0.4,
                then depth coverage of 10,9,8,7,and 6 is counted as binding
                sites and the rest are disregarded.

            'TopDepthNumber': The number of layers of depth from the highest
                depth support that should be selected is input, and the cutoff
                is accordingly selected.

            'MinimumDepthNumber': The cut-off is selected based on the minimum
                depth support each binding site should have.

            'TopSitesNumber': The cut-off is selected such that the top selected
                number of binding sites remains supported. For example, the top
                100 sites may be preserved (from a set of, say, 1000 overlapping
                sites)

            'TopSitesRatio': The cut-off is selected much like above, but the
                ratio of top sites that should be selected is specified instead.
                For example, in the above example, 0.1 could be specified
                instead.

        As of now, calling overlap_collapse() loses all annotation data
        associated with the original range interval data.
